# Ecosystem

This chapter lists third-party projects that extend godot-rust with additional functionality: tools, libraries, integrations, apps, and more.
The projects are grouped by type of project and their respective domain (although such classification is not always clear-cut).

If you'd like to add a project, please read [Contributing](#contributing)!

A list for games is also planned, and will be showcased on a separate page.

## Contributing

If you have a project that might fit this list, great! You don't have to be the author -- if you've come across something that will make other
people's lives easier, please share it!

To keep this list useful for visitors, there are a few acceptance criteria:

- The project must be related to godot-rust (not only Rust or only Godot). It should use Godot 4.
- There's already something tangible with at least minimal docs/examples.
  - This could be a usable library on GitHub, a working demo, etc. No need for a crate release or very polished presentation; the idea is
    that the project is accessible for newcomers.
  - To discuss ideas and WIP prototypes, feel free to start a discussion [in `#showcase` on Discord][discord-showcase]!
- The author should be willing to maintain the project for a while.
  - GDExtension has a very good track record with binary compatibility, and [godot-rust supports extensions down to Godot 4.1][gdext-compat].
    So if you integrate via extensions (e.g. as an editor plugin), your project tends to be more future-proof than with source code.
  - That said, we don't have major breaking changes very often.
- If the project is intended for distribution and usage, make sure it comes with a license (e.g. an open-source one for software, or
  Creative Commons for artworks).

Once that's sorted, please open a pull request directly to the [book repository][book-repo]. If you're not sure about
the criteria or have other questions, don't hesitate to ask on Discord or the [book issue tracker][book-issues].

```admonish tip title="A thriving ecosystem"
Every single project enriches the space around Godot and Rust, and lets more and more people enjoy game development.
Thanks a lot to every contributor!
