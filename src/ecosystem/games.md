# Games

Godot is primarily a _game_ engine, and Rust has a reputation of coming with ~~frustrating~~ interesting engineering challenges when
used for game development. Yet, users keep putting godot-rust's [pragmatic] approach to the test and push the project to its limits,
for which we are very thankful!

[pragmatic]: ../contribute/philosophy.md

This page lists some godot-rust games built by the community. This is an early draft, the list will be curated over time.
Depending on the number of entries, it may be necessary to remove/archive older or less active entries, or split it into multiple pages.
