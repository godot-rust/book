# Engine singletons

It is important for you to understand the [Singleton pattern][singleton] to
properly utilize this system.

```admonish info title="Controversy"
The "Singleton pattern" is often referred to as an anti-pattern, because it violates several good practices for clean, modular code. However, it is
also a tool that can be used to solve certain design problems. As such, it is used internally by Godot, and is available to godot-rust
users as well.

Read more about criticisms [here][singleton-crit].
```

An engine singleton is registered through [`godot::engine::Engine`][api-engine].

Custom engine singletons in Godot:

- are `Object` types
- are always accessible to GDScript and GDExtension languages
- must be manually registered and unregistered in the `InitLevel::Scene` step

Godot provides _many_ built-in singletons in its API. You can find a full list [here][godot-singleton-list].

## Defining a singleton

Defining a singleton is the same as registering a custom class.

```rust
#[derive(GodotClass)]
#[class(tool, init, base=Object)]
struct MyEditorSingleton {
    base: Base<Object>,
}

#[godot_api]
impl MyEditorSingleton {
    #[func]
    fn foo(&mut self) {}
}
```


## Registering a singleton

Registering singletons is done during the `InitLevel::Scene` stage of initialization.

To achieve this, we can customize our init/shutdown routines by overriding `ExtensionLibrary` trait methods.

```rust
struct MyExtension;

unsafe impl ExtensionLibrary for MyExtension {
    fn on_level_init(level: InitLevel) {
        if level == InitLevel::Scene {
            // The StringName identifies your singleton and can be
            // used later to access it.
            Engine::singleton().register_singleton(
                StringName::from("MyEditorSingleton"),
                MyEditorSingleton::new_alloc().upcast(),
            );
        }
    }

    fn on_level_deinit(level: InitLevel) {
        if level == InitLevel::Scene {
            // Unregistering is needed to avoid memory leaks and 
            // warnings, especially for hot reloading.
            Engine::singleton().unregister_singleton(
                StringName::from("MyEditorSingleton")
            );
        }
    }
}
```


## Calling from GDScript

Now that your singleton is available (and once you've recompiled and reloaded), you should be able to access it from GDScript like so:

```php
extends Node

func _ready() -> void:
    MyEditorSingleton.foo()
```


## Calling from Rust

You may also want to access your singleton from Rust as well.

```rust
godot::engine::Engine::singleton()
    .get_singleton(StringName::from("MyEditorSingleton"));
```

For more information on this method, refer to [the API docs][method-get-singleton].

## Singletons and the `SceneTree`

Singletons cannot safely access the scene tree. At any given moment, they may exist without a scene tree being active.
While it is technically possible to access the tree through hacky methods, it is **highly recommended** to use a
custom `EditorPlugin` for this purpose. Creating an `EditorPlugin` allows for registering an "autoload singleton" which is a `Node` (or
 derived) type and is automatically loaded into the `SceneTree` by Godot when the game starts.
