# Custom Resources

Custom `Resource`s are exposed to the end user to use within their development. `Resource`s can store data that is easily edited from within
the editor GUI. For example, you can create a custom `AudioStream` type that handles a new and interesting audio file type.


## Registering a `Resource`

This workflow is similar to the [Hello World example][hello]:

```rust
#[derive(GodotClass)]
#[class(tool, init, base=Resource)]
struct ResourceType {
    #[base]
    base: Base<Resource>,
}
```

It is important that similar to defining custom resources in GDScript, marking this class as a "tool class"
is required to be usable within the editor.

The above resource does not export any variables. While not all resources require exported variables, most do.

The systems for registering functions, properties, and more are described in detail in the
[Registering Rust symbols][register] section.
