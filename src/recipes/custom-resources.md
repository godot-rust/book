# Custom resources

Custom `Resource`s are exposed to the end user to use within their development. `Resource`s can store data that is easily edited from within
the editor GUI. For example, you can create a custom `AudioStream` type that handles a new and interesting audio file type.


## Registering a `Resource`

This workflow is similar to the [Hello World example][hello]:

```rust
#[derive(GodotClass)]
#[class(init, base=Resource)]
struct ResourceType {
    base: Base<Resource>,
}
```

The above resource does not export any variables. While not all resources require exported variables, most do.

To execute code within the Godot Editor (e.g., overriding `set_property` to run custom logic when editing Inspector properties),
you should annotate the class with `#[class(tool)]`.

```rust
#[derive(GodotClass)]
#[class(tool, init, base=Resource)]
struct ResourceType {
    base: Base<Resource>,
}

#[godot_api]
impl IResource for ResourceType {
    // String representation of the object.
    fn to_string(&self) -> GString { ... }

    // Called when the object receives a Godot notification.
    fn on_notification(&mut self, what: ObjectNotification) { ... }

    // Called whenever get() is called or Godot gets the value of a property.
    fn get_property(&self, property: StringName) -> Option<Variant> { ... }

    // Called whenever Godot set() is called or Godot sets the value of a property.
    fn set_property(&mut self, property: StringName, value: Variant) -> bool { ... }

    // Called whenever Godot get_property_list() is called,
    // the returned vector here is appended to the existing list of properties.
    fn get_property_list(&mut self) -> Vec<PropertyInfo> { ... }

    // Called whenever Godot retrieves value of property. Allows to customize existing properties.
    // Every property info goes through this method, except properties added with get_property_list().
    fn validate_property(&self, property: &mut PropertyInfo) { ... }

    // Called by Godot to tell if a property has a custom revert or not.
    fn property_get_revert(&self, property: StringName) -> Option<Variant> { ... }

    fn setup_local_to_scene(&mut self) { ... }
}

```

It is important that similar to defining custom resources in GDScript, marking this class as a "tool class"
is required to be usable within the editor.

The systems for registering functions, properties, and more are described in detail in the
[Registering Rust symbols][register] section.
