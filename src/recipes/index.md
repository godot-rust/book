# Recipes


## Custom resources

With godot-rust, you are able to define custom `Resource` classes which are then available to the end user.


## Editor plugins

`EditorPlugin` types are loaded during editor and runtime and are able to access the editor as well as the scene tree. This type follows the same
functionality that a typical `EditorPlugin` class written in GDScript would, but crucially with access to the _entire Rust ecosystem_.


## Engine singletons

An Engine Singleton is a class instance that is always globally available (following the Singleton pattern). However,
it cannot access the `SceneTree` through any reliable means.


## Custom icons

Adding custom icons to your classes is actually fairly simple!
