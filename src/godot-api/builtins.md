# Built-in types

The so-called "built-in types" or just "builtins" are the basic types that Godot provides. Notably, these are not _classes_.
See also [basic built-in types in Godot][godot-docs-builtins].

## List of types

Here is an exhaustive list of all built-in types, by category. We use the GDScript names; below, we explain how they map to Rust.

**Simple types**

- Boolean: `bool`
- Numeric: `int`, `float`

**Composite types**

- Variant (able to hold anything): `Variant`
- String types: `String`, `StringName`, `NodePath`
- Ref-counted containers: `Array` (`Array[T]`), `Dictionary`
- Packed arrays: `Packed*Array` for following element types:  
  `Byte`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Float32`, `Float64`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`[^packed-vec4], `Color`, `String`
- Functional: `Callable`, `Signal`

**Geometric types**

- Vectors: `Vector2`, `Vector2i`, `Vector3`, `Vector3i`, `Vector4`, `Vector4i`
- Bounding boxes: `Rect2`, `Rect2i`, `AABB`
- Matrices: `Transform2D`, `Transform3D`, `Basis`, `Projection`
- Rotation: `Quaternion`
- Geometric objects: `Plane`

**Miscellaneous**

- Color: `Color`
- Resource ID: `RID`


### Rust mapping

Rust types in the gdext API represent the corresponding Godot types in the closest way possible. They are used in parameter and return type
position of API functions, for example.

Most builtins have a 1:1 equivalent (e.g. `Vector2f`, `Color` etc.). The following list highlights some noteworthy mappings:

| GDScript type             | Rust type                             | Rust example expression   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `int`                     | `i64`[^num-types]                     | `-12345`                  |
| `float`                   | `f64`[^num-types]                     | `3.14159`                 |
| `real`                    | `real` (either `f32` or `f64`)        | `real!(3.14159)`          |
| `String`                  | `GString`                             | `"Some string".into()`    |
| `StringName`              | `StringName`                          | `"MyClass".into()`        |
| `NodePath`                | `NodePath`                            | `Nodes/MyNode".into()`    |
| `Array[T]`                | `Array<T>`                            | `array![1, 2, 3]`         |
| `Array`                   | `VariantArray`<br>or `Array<Variant>` | `varray![1, "two", true]` |
| `Dictionary`              | `Dictionary`                          | `dict!{"key": "value"}`   |
| `AABB`                    | `Aabb`                                | `Aabb::new(pos, size)`    |
| `Object`                  | `Gd<Object>`                          | `Object::new_alloc()`     |
| `SomeClass`               | `Gd<SomeClass>`                       | `Resource::new_gd()`      |
| `SomeClass` (nullable)    | `Option<Gd<SomeClass>>`               | `None`                    |
| `Variant` (also implicit) | `Variant`                             | `Variant::nil()`          |

Note that Godot does not have nullability information in its class API yet. This means that we have to conservatively assume that objects can
be null, and thus use `Option<Gd<T>>` instead of `Gd<T>` for object return types. This often needs unnecessary unwrapping.

Nullable types are being looked into [on Godot side][godot-nullability-issue]. If there is no upstream solution for a while, we may consider our
own workarounds, but it may come with manual annotation of many APIs.


## String types

Godot provides three string types: `String` ([`GString`][api-gstring] in Rust), [`StringName`][api-stringname], and [`NodePath`][api-nodepath].
`GString` is used as a general-purpose string, while `StringName` is often used for identifiers like class or action names.
The idea is that `StringName` is cheap to construct and compare.[^string-name-Rust]

These types all support `From` traits to convert to/from Rust `String`, and from `&str`. You can thus use `"some_string".into()` expressions.
If you need more explicit typing, use `StringName::from("some_string")`.

`StringName` in particular provides a direct conversion from C-string literals such as `c"string"`, [introduced in Rust 1.77][rust-c-strings].
This can be used for _static_ C-strings, i.e. ones that remain allocated for the entire program lifetime. Don't use them for short-lived ones.


## Arrays and dictionaries

Godot's linear collection type is [`Array<T>`][api-array]. It is generic over its element type `T`, which can be one of the supported Godot types
(generally anything that can be represented by `Variant`). A special type `VariantArray` is provided as an alias for `Array<Variant>`, which is
used when the element type is dynamically typed.

[`Dictionary`][api-dictionary] is a key-value store, where both keys and values are `Variant`. Godot currently does not support generic
dictionaries, although this feature is [under discussion][godot-generic-dicts].

Arrays and dictionaries can be constructed using three macros:

```rust
let a = array![1, 2, 3];          // Array<i64>
let b = varray![1, "two", true];  // Array<Variant>
let c = dict!{"key": "value"};    // Dictionary
```

Their API is similar, but not identical to Rust's standard types `Vec` and `HashMap`. An important difference is that `Array` and `Dictionary`
are reference-counted, which means that `clone()` will not create an independent copy, but another reference to the same instance. Furthermore,
since internal elements are stored as variants, they are not accessible by reference. This is why the `[]` operator (`Index/IndexMut` traits)
is absent, and `at()` is provided instead, returning by value.

```rust
let a = array![0, 11, 22];

assert_eq!(a.len(), 3);
assert_eq!(a.at(1), 11);         // Panics on out-of-bounds.
assert_eq!(a.get(1), Some(11));  // Also by value, not Some(&11).

let mut b = a.clone();   // Increment reference-count.
b.set(2, 33);            // Modify new ref.
assert_eq!(a.at(2), 33); // Original array has changed.

b.clear();
assert!(b.is_empty());
assert_eq!(b, Array::new()); // new() creates an empty array.
```

```rust
let c = dict! {
    "str": "hello",
    "int": 42,
    "bool": true,
};

assert_eq!(c.len(), 3);
assert_eq!(c.at("str"), "hello".to_variant());    // Panics on missing key.
assert_eq!(c.get("int"), Some(42.to_variant()));  // Option<Variant>, again by value.

let mut d = c.clone();            // Increment reference-count.
d.insert("float", 3.14);          // Modify new ref.
assert!(c.contains_key("float")); // Original dict has changed.
```

To iterate, you can use `iter_shared()`. This method works almost like `iter()` on Rust collections, but the name highlights that you do not
have unique access to the collection during iteration, since there might exist another reference to the collection. This also means it's your
responsibility to ensure that the array/dictionary is not modified in unintended ways during iteration (which should be safe, but may lead to
data inconsistencies).

```rust
let a = array!["one", "two", "three"];
let d = dict!{"one": 1, "two": 2.0, "three": Vector3::ZERO};

for elem in a.iter_shared() {
    // elem has type GString.
    println!("Element: {elem}");
}

for (key, value) in d.iter_shared() {
    // key and value both have type Variant.
    println!("Key: {key}, value: {value}");
}
```


## Packed arrays

[`Packed*Array`][api-packed-array] types are used for storing elements space-efficiently ("packed") in contiguous memory.
The `*` stands for the element type, e.g. `PackedByteArray` or `PackedVector3Array`.

```rust
// Create from slices.
let bytes = PackedByteArray::from(&[0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C]);
let ints = PackedInt32Array::from(&[1, 2, 3]);

// Get/set individual elements using Index and IndexMut operators.
ints[1] = 5;
assert_eq!(ints[1], &5);

// Access as Rust shared/mutable slices.
let bytes_slice: &[u8] = b.as_slice();
let ints_slice: &mut [i32] = i.as_mut_slice();

// Access sub-ranges of the array using the same type.
let part: PackedByteArray = bytes.subarray(1, 3); // 1..3, or 1..=2
assert_eq!(part.as_slice(), &[0x0B, 0x0C]);
```

Unlike `Array`, packed arrays use copy-on-write instead of reference counting. When you clone a packed array, you get a new independent instance.
Cloning is cheap as long as you don't modify either instance. Once you use a write operation (anything with `&mut self`), the packed array will
allocate its own memory and copy the data.

**Footnotes**

[^packed-vec4]: `PackedVector4Array` is only available since Godot version 4.3; added in [PR #85474][godot-packed-vector4].

[^num-types]: Godot's `int` and `float` types are canonically mapped to `i64` and `f64` in Rust. However, some Godot APIs specify the domain of
these types more specifically, so it's possible to encounter `i8`, `u64`, `f32` etc.

[^string-name-Rust]: When constructing `StringName` from `&str` or `String`, the conversion is rather expensive, since UTF-8 is re-encoded as
UTF-32. As Rust recently introduced C-string literals (`c"hello"`), we can now directly construct from them in case of ASCII. This is more
efficient, but keeps memory allocated until shutdown, so don't use it for rarely used temporaries.
See [API docs][api-stringname] and [issue #531][issue-stringname-perf] for more information.
